### Cassandra Basics
- Cassandra is open-source, distributed NoSQL DB
- Implements partitioned wide-column storage model
- Wide-column DB: names and format of columns can vary across rows even within same table

#### Data Model

- **Keyspace** - data containers (analogous to 'databases' in SQL)
	- Contains many tables
	- Owns configuration information (such as configured replication strategy)
	- Owns user-defined-types (UDTs)
- **Table** - container for data in the form of rows
- **Row** - container for data represented by a primary key and contains columns
- **Column** - represented by a name, type, value
	- Since Cassandra is wide-column database, specified columns can vary per row in table
