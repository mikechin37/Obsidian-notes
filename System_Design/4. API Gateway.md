#### Tracing a Request
1. Request Validation
	- Check if properly formatted: 
		- Incoming request URL is valid
		- Required headers are present
		- If request body matches expected format
2. Middleware
	- "I'll add a API Gateway to handle routing and basic middleware"
	- Most popular middleware are:
		- Authentication
		- Rate Limiting
		- IP Whitelisting/blacklisting
	- Full list of middleware tasks:
		- Authenticate requests using JWT tokens
		- Limit request rates to prevent abuse
		- Terminate SSL connections
		- Log and monitor traffic
		- Compress responses
		- Handle CORS headers
		- Whitelist/blacklist IPs
		- Validate request sizes
		- Handle response timeouts
		- Version APIs
		- Throttle traffic
		- Integrate with service discovery
3. Routing
	- Gateway maintains routing table to map request to backend service based on:
		- URL paths (eg. `/users/*`)
		- HTTP methods (eg. GET, POST, etc)
		- Query parameters (eg. ?userId=123)
		- Request headers (eg. Accept-Version: v2 -> allows API versioning)
4. Backend Communication
	- Can translate between different protocols if services use different protocol like gRPC, HTTP
	- Not common in practice
5. Response Transformation
	- Gateway will transform response from backend service into format requested by client (eg. gRPC response transformed into JSON)
6. Caching
	- Gateway can cache in memory or in distributed cache like Redis
	- Can implement various caching strategies:
		1. Full Response Caching
		2. Partial Caching: only cache specific parts of responses
		3. Cache invalidation

#### Scaling an API Gateway

Horizontal Scaling
- Can add more gateway instances behind a load balancer
1. Client-to-Gateway Load Balancing
	- Dedicated LB in front of API Gateway instances (like AWS ELB or NGINX)
2. Gateway-to-Service Load Balancing
	- for multiple instances of backend services
- Abstracted in interview as single box "API Gateway and Load Balancer"
Global Distribution
- Deploy API Gateways closer to your users, which involves
1. Regional Deployments
	- Deploy gateway instance in multiple geographic regions
2. DNS-based Routing
	- Use GeoDNS to route users to nearest gateway
3. Configuration Synchronization
	- Sync routing rules and polices across regions
