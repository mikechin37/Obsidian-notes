#### Intro
- Fully-Managed: AWS handles all operational tasks - hardware provisioning, configuration, patching, and scaling
- Highly Scalable: Can handle massive amounts of data and traffic, scaling up or down to meet application's needs without performance hit
- Key-value: DynamoDB is NoSQL DB using key-value model for flexible data storage/retrieval

#### Data Model
- **Tables**: top-level data structure defined by mandatory primary key
	- Supports secondary indexes - enables queries on non-primary key attributes
- **Items**: Correspond to rows in relational DB and contain a collection of attributes
- **Attributes**: Key-value pairs that can vary in type, and be nested

- DynamoDB is schema-less, so don't need to define schema before inserting data
	- Provides high flexibility but requires careful data validation at application level since attribute uniformity is not enforced
- DynamoDB uses JSON for data transmission but it is merely transport format - actual storage format is proprietary
- Sample `users` table:
```
{
  "PersonID": 101,
  "LastName": "Smith",
  "FirstName": "Fred",
  "Phone": "555-4321"
},
{
  "PersonID": 102,
  "LastName": "Jones",
  "FirstName": "Mary",
  "Address": {
    "Street": "123 Main",
    "City": "Anytown",
    "State": "OH",
    "ZIPCode": 12345
  }
},
{
  "PersonID": 103,
  "LastName": "Stephens",
  "FirstName": "Howard",
  "Address": {
    "Street": "123 Main",
    "City": "London",
    "PostalCode": "ER3 5K8"
  },
  "FavoriteColor": "Blue"
}
```

#### Partition Key and Sort Key
Primary Key consists of one or two attributes:
1. **Partition Key**: Single attribute that uniquely identifies each item in table
	- Also hashed to determine the partition where item is stored
2. **Sort Key** (Optional)
	- Used to order items with the same partition key value, enabling efficient range queries and sorting within a partition

Under the hood:
- **Consistent Hashing** for Partition keys
- **B-trees for Sort Keys**: Within each partition, DynamoDB organizes items in a B-tree data structure indexed by sort key
- **Composite Key Operations**: When querying with both keys, DynamoDB uses the partition key's hash to find the right node, then uses the sort key to traverse the B-tree to find specific item
- In summary, DynamoDB achieves horizontal scalability (through partitioning) and efficient querying within partitions (through B-tree indexing)

#### Secondary Indexes
- Two types of secondary indexes:
1. **Global Secondary Index (GSI)**: Index with partition key and optional sort key that differs from the table's partition key
	- Allows you to query items based on attributes other than table's partition key
	- Since GSIs use different partition key, data is stored on entirely different physical partitions from the base table and is replicated separately
	- Use GSI for global search across all partitions (eg search by email in user database)
2. **Local Secondary Index (LSI)**: Index with same partition key as table's primary key but a different sort key
	- Enables range queries and sorting within a partition
	- Since LSIs use same partition key as base table, stored on same physical partition
	- Use LSI for local search within partitions (eg find recent orders within customer partition)
- GSIs maintain their own separate partitions and replicas
	- Allows for greater query flexibility but requires additional storage and processing overhead
- LSIs stored locally with the base table items
	- Makes more efficient for queries within a partition but limits flexibility
- For message chat example:
	- Partition key is chat_id, sort key is message_id 
	- GSI to show users all messages sent across all chats: partition key user_id, sort key message_id
	- LSI to show messages with most attachments: partition key chat_id, sort key num_attachments
#### Under the Hood
1. GSIs
	- Each GSI is a separate table with its own partition scheme
	- When item is added, updated, or deleted in main table, DynamoDB asynchronously updates the GSI
	- GSI uses same consistent hashing mechanism 
2. LSIs
	- LSIs co-located with the main table's partitions
	- LSIs maintain a separate B-tree structure indexed on the LSI's sort key
	- Updates to LSIs are done synchronously with main table updated to ensure strong consistency
3. Index Maintenance
	- DynamoDB automatically propagates changes from main table to all secondary indexes
	- GSIs propagation - eventually consistent
	- LSIs propagation - strongly consistent
4. Query Processing
	- When a query uses a secondary index, DynamoDB routes query to the appropriate index table (for GSIs) or index structure (for LSIs)

#### Accessing Data
- Two ways to access data in DynamoDB
1. **Scan Operation**: Read every item in a table or index and return the results in a paginated response
	- Useful but inefficient for large datasets 
```
const params = {
  TableName: 'users'
};

dynamodb.scan(params, (err, data) => {
  if (err) console.error(err);
  else console.log(data);
});
```
2. **Query Operation**: Retrieve items using match on primary key or secondary index key attributes
```
const params = {
  TableName: 'users',
  KeyConditionExpression: 'user_id = :id',
  ExpressionAttributeValues: {
    ':id': 101
  }
};

dynamodb.query(params, (err, data) => {
  if (err) console.error(err);
  else console.log(data);
});
```

- Key Note: DynamoDB reads the entire item (record) by default unlike SQL where you can select specific fields
	- Costly in terms of read capacity units (RCUs) and network bandwidth
	- Want to normalize data into separate tables to avoid unnecessary data transfer \
		- (eg separate out reviews from `business` table so we dont read reviews when we just want name of business)
